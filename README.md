# Tiny Library
It is a free and open-source **Libraries Collection**, created by [Duckafire](https://github.com/duckafire). <br>
This collection contains libraries created specifically for use on the fantasy computer/console [Tic80](https://tic80.com),
with the main objective to facilitate the creation of *tiny* games.
